Redux Purpose - 
                useful for state management in cross component or app-wide state.
                redux is predictable state management library for javascript apps
                same work as createContext hook. 

React-context vs Redux
                we can use both
                in react - context we have to write lot of code.. and the apps become slower.
                for evevy liitle change context will repaint the apps.
                redux is much faster with great performamnce.
