Undoing Changes - when we add or commit some changes and later on want to delete those changes we can use following commands.
1. when changes are added but not commited - git reset file-name // for 1 file
					     git reset // for multiple files at a time

2. When changes are added and commited -git reset HEAD~1


git log // to see all commits

			   git reset --hard hash-code-commit



fork - it is like copy of a repo with same code and setting. like a rough copy
